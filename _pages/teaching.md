For those who are interested, here is more about my personal stories.

I have always been enjoying doing mathematical and physical sciences. Nevertheless, after completing a bachelor’s degree in physics at Fudan University followed by a master’s degree in theoretical physics at Imperial College, I became crystal clear that my talents in mathematics and physics are far from what are needed to become a research scienctist, so I decided to pass on my love for physics to the younger generation. And so, my teaching career in international secondary education began in 2011.

Since then, I have been teaching several A-Level courses (subject-based academic qualifications taken by 16-18 year olds in the UK and internationally), including physics, pure mathematics, mechanics, and decision theory, during which I have gained experience and understanding in curriculum design, classroom management and student assessment. Personally, I enjoy transforming my teaching plans into beautifully organized notes and lecture slides, sometimes just to give myself a goal, and this comes with a delightful bonus that these teaching materials that I have created have helped many students to succeed in their courses.

I have also helped students with their university applications, among which there are offer holders of Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial, UCL, KCL, Warwick, Manchester, Bristol, Edinburgh, etc. I helped transform students’ personal statements, from which I enjoyed learning new things and brainstorming ideas. I also developed a series of systematic lectures for Oxford applicants to succeed in ESAT and TMUA tests (previously PAT and MAT tests), together with a set of Oxbridge mock interview questions for different subject options. These have now become part of my job that I find extremely exciting and refreshing.

Here are a list of courses that I have taught and/or designed:
