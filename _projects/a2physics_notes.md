This is a set of very concise lecture notes written for [CIE A-level Physics](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-international-as-and-a-level-physics-9702/) (syllabus code 9702). Presumably the target audience of the notes are students studying the relevant course.

I am certain that there are tons of typos in the notes. If you spot any error, please let me know.

Here are some screenshots from the notes.
