This is a set of very concise lecture notes written for [CIE A-Level Further Mechanics](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-international-as-and-a-level-mathematics-further-9231/) (syllabus code 9231). Presumably the target audience of the notes are students studying the relevant A-Level course.

These notes are supposed to be self-contained. A handful of worked examples are included to give the reader some rough idea about how exam-style questions look like and how the principles developed in the note can be applied to solve them. I also intend to introduce the physical concepts and principles required by the syllabus using a more mathematical approach, so that the reader may develop an appreciation of the interplay between mathematics and physics.

Please also be noted that these notes were written for the syllabus before 2019. There are significant changes to the syllabus since 2020. Some topics like simle harmonic motion and rotational mechanics are removed from the old syllabus, and some others are added to the new syllabus. There might be changes to the style of the questions as well. So the topics covered in these notes are no longer applicable to the new syllabus. But you are still free to use it as you wish.

I hope you enjoy reading the notes. But if you spot any mistake (as I guarantee there will be a lot), please let me know.
